## Contributing

All contributions are welcome. However, please expect breaking changes as this project is in active
development. A contributor license agreement (CLA), or change in license is under consideration.
Please to reach out before making significant contributions.

## Known Issues

- The app cannot read images, videos, voice notes, or other non-text content. Contextual suggestions
  may be limited in these cases.
- Hint text 'Message' in WhatsApp is treated as typed text on devices running Android 12 or lower.
- RTL support is limited.
- Banking apps in asia commonly block apps from unknown sources having accessibility services
  permission due to security reasons. If you are facing this issue, you can
  setup [an accessibility shortcut](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/7650693?hl=en#step_1)
  to toggle the coreply on/off quickly. In the future there might be a Play Store listing to avoid
  this issue.
